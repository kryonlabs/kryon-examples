# Markdown Example

This is a paragraph demonstrating basic text rendering from a Markdown file.

## Features (Simulated)

*   List Item 1
*   List Item 2
    *   Indented Item

**Bold Text** and *italic text* should be rendered appropriately by the runtime handler (using multiple `Text` elements potentially).

---

A horizontal rule might be rendered as a thin `Container`.

```text
Code blocks would need special handling.
```
